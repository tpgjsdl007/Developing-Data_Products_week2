## Instruction
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Creating a creative map using leaflet

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

seniors_hospital <- c("<a href= 'http://www.happysn.co.kr'>seniors hospital</a>")

my_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles()

my_map <- my_map %>%
  addMarkers(lat=36.314086, lng=127.415776, 
             popup= seniors_hospital)
my_map
```
